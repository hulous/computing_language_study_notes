Gary Kildall (1942â€“1994) was an American computer scientist and entrepreneur, widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computing revolution. Born in Seattle, Washington, he initially pursued mathematics at the University of Washington, earning both bachelor's and master's degrees. His growing interest in computing led him to complete a Ph.D. in computer science in 1972.([Wikipedia][1])

While teaching at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, Kildall began consulting for Intel. In 1973, he developed PL/M (Programming Language for Microcomputers), the first high-level language designed for microprocessors. The following year, he created CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers), a groundbreaking operating system that allowed microcomputers to interface with disk drives. CP/M became the dominant OS for early personal computers, thanks to its portability and compatibility across various hardware platforms. ([Wikipedia][2], [Wikipedia][1], [ETHW][3])

To commercialize CP/M, Kildall and his wife, Dorothy McEwen, founded Digital Research Inc. in 1974. The company played a pivotal role in the early software industry, developing several influential products. Notably, Kildall also introduced the concept of the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which standardized hardware-software interactions in microcomputers. ([Allen School News][4])

Despite his innovations, Kildall is often remembered for a missed opportunity: when IBM was seeking an operating system for its first personal computer, negotiations with Digital Research fell through. IBM subsequently partnered with Microsoft, whose MS-DOS would dominate the PC market. This turn of events significantly impacted the trajectory of personal computing.

Beyond his technical contributions, Kildall co-hosted the PBS television program "Computer Chronicles" in the 1980s, helping to educate the public about emerging computer technologies. He passed away in 1994, but his legacy endures in the foundations of modern computing.([Wikipedia][1], [wired.com][6])

For those interested in a deeper insight into his experiences and perspectives, Kildall's memoir, *Computer Connections: People, Places, and Events in the Evolution of the Personal Computer Industry*, is available as a free download. ([IEEE Spectrum][7])
